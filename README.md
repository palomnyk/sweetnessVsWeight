#Overview
This is a repository of code, data, and output from a collaboration with 
Dr. Kelly Higgins studying whether current literature supports a conclusion on
whether sweetness in food relates to obesity.

Each type of figure (Sankey, forest, bar) has its own folder, input data, and 
output folder. However, the bar plot didn't make it into the final version of
the paper. 

Plots were generated using R, version 4.3.0, and run on the x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) platform on Windows 10. Forest plots were generated using ggplot2, version 3.4.2. Sankey plots were generated using networkD3, version 0.4.
