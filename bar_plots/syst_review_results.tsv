In particular, very little data exist regarding the role of artificial sweeteners in glucose metabolism in children. Our growing understanding of the active metabolic role played by such chemicals in animal models should spur further research into the effects of these common food additives in humans."

3	561	Miller 2014	2014	0	0	0	1	"In conclusion, the meta-analysis of observational studies showed a small positive association between LCS intake and BMI, but no association with body weight or fat mass. On the other hand, data from RCTs, which provide the highest quality of evidence for examining the potentially causal effects of LCS intake on body weight, indicate that substituting LCSs for calorically dense alternatives results in a modest reduction of body weight, BMI, fat mass, and waist circumference. Compared with the consistent findings among the RCTs, results from prospective cohort studies were limited and more difficult to interpret, particularly because of inadequate control of important confounders, including total energy intake and baseline differences between LCS consumers and nonconsumers in body weight and composition. On the basis of the available scientific literature to date, substituting LCS options for their regular-calorie versions results in a modest weight loss andmay be a useful dietary tool to improve compliance with weight-loss or weight-maintenance plans."

4	1394	Pereira 2014	2014	1	0	0	1	"Of the totality of scientific evidence to date, there is a pattern across studies of an increased risk of weight gain and obesity with higher intakes of SSBs. However, it remains difficult to establish the strength of the association and the independence from other potentially confounding factors. The primary reason for such tentative conclusions regarding the strength of this association is the limited number and scope of controlled trials on this topic, and the unimpressive findings of those that have been conducted. Last, another recent development has been a focus on the possible role of ASBs in the upregulation of appetite and weight gain over time. This hypothesis has not held up to rigorous epidemiologic methods, and in fact, there is somewhat consistent evidence from prospective studies and from randomized trials that ASBs may be protective, perhaps as protective as water, in preventing obesity when compared with SSBs."

The studies available to test these effects included adults and children, with healthy weight, overweight and obesity, and consumption of LCS or sugar in beverages, or in beverages and foods. In contrast, there was no clear evidence of effects on BW or EI of LCS compared with the consumption of water/nothing. There were, however, substantial differences in results across studies, so further research on this question would be valuable. There was also no evidence overall of an effect of LCS consumed in capsules vs placebo capsules, indicating that, beyond the effect of reduced sugar intake, there is no meaningful post-ingestive effect of LCS on energy balance. Occurrence of adverse events did not differ between LCS and comparator interventions."	Decrease BW/more beneficial	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0

20	1440	WorldHealth 2022	2022	1	0	0	1	"The results of this review suggest that, in shorter-term RCTs, those consuming NSS had lower body weight and BMI at the end of the trials than those not consuming NSS, particularly when compared with sugars (including when NSS were explicitly used as replacements for sugars), but not when compared with water. Those consuming NSS also exhibited a significant reduction in energy intake, primarily when NSS were compared to sugars. Therefore, NSS may be effective at assisting with short-term weight loss when their use leads to a reduction in total energy intake. Results from prospective cohort studies suggest the possibility of long-term harm in the form of increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Further research is needed to determine whether the observed associations are genuine or a result of reverse causation and/or residual confounding."
